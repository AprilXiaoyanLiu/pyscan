The base data types.

* :any:`Point`
* :any:`WPoint`
* :any:`LPoint`
* :any:`Point3`
* :any:`WPoint3`
* :any:`LPoint3`
* :any:`Trajectory`

There are several types of regions of interest.

* :any:`Halfplane`
* :any:`Halfspace`
* :any:`Disk`
* :any:`Rectangle`

Scanning functions can be divided into unlabeled and labeled scanning. The unlabeled scanning functions are generally faster, but the labeled scanning function can be used for trajectory data sets or for 
encoding other information into the points.
